# Module 1 Project:  Memory Game

The objective of the game is for the player to find all matching pairs on the game board before exceeding the number of clicks allowed for that level. The number of cards on the board increase as the player completes each level. Once the maximum number of click have been exceeded the cards will remain on the image side.
